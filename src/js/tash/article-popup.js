   		<p>From the moment you die, your body triggers a series of changes. Once animated and self-sustaining, it is now a cadaver set on a rapid and inevitable path of decomposition. From the moment you are buried, the earth too gradually begins to deteriorate from the impact of funeral rituals.</p>
   		<p>Consider: every year, approximately 30 million board feet of hardwoods, 5,400,000 tons of copper and bronze, 180,544,000 tons of steel, 3,272,000 tons of concrete and 827,060 gallons of embalming fluid are buried six feet underground along with our deceased loved ones in the U.S. alone.</p>
   		<p>The environmental cost of the current state of the American funeral industry can be as crippling as the exorbitant costs to bury a loved one. Now, those in the business of death and dying are starting to look at some of their most deeply entrenched problems and how to change them.</p>
   		<p>It’s an unavoidable truth: everything comes back to death. “At one point in our lives almost everyone will have to plan a funeral,” said Laura Benson of Benson Family Funeral Home in Chicago.</p>
   		<p>This kind of thinking makes some people queasy. That’s why we often leave the unmentionable decisions of death and dying until the very end of our lives, if we address them at all.</p>
   		<p>But the earlier you talk about death, the more likely you will be to come to some crucial conclusions about your mortal departure—and your final footprint. That is, the last imprint you will leave upon the earth, in both a literal and environmental sense.</p>
   		<p>The number of green burials is slowly on the rise. The Green Burial Council has currently approved over 30 in a handful of states. These sites can range in their definition of a green burial. Some look like traditional cemeteries with small twists such as digging graves with shovels instead of heavy machinery. Others look like a typical woodland area with names carved on jagged rocks, an unassuming gravesite.</p>
   		<p>Here’s how the death industry is greening the grave today.</p>

   		<h5>A Costly Cadaver</h5>

   		<p>Each year in North America alone, the steel used in caskets and vaults is enough to build a bridge the size of San Francisco’s Golden Gate. The concrete used to construct burial vaults could build a 535-mile highway, with enough left to fill every pothole in the city of Chicago.</p>
   		<p>Despite the steep financial cost, burials remain one of the most ubiquitous funeral practices in the nation – with the most detrimental effects to the environment. Yet cremations come in a close second.</p>
   		<p>But aren’t cremations green? Not even close, say some environmentalists and scientists.</p>
   		<p>“It takes a lot of energy to reach the required temperature of more than 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit to cremate a body,” according to a 2012 Planet Green study. “As the corpse and casket burn, the process releases toxins, including hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids, dioxin, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide.”</p>
   		<p>Together, these practices expand our carbon footprint.</p>
   		<p>“Materials such as wood in coffins take years to decompose in the soil,” said authors of the Planet Green study. “The chemicals used in embalming can seep into communities’ soil - and eventually in their groundwater.”</p>
   		<p>Eventually, those chemicals can seep into all parts of our environment, said documentarian Deborah Garcia, who just produced the film "The Symphony of the Soil."</p>
   		<p>“Soil is an endangered species,” she said. “People are soil-blind. America is particularly blessed with good soil, especially the Midwest. If you use it and abuse it, you begin to run out of it.”</p>
   		<p>We do not have endless resources, said Garcia.</p>
   		<p>“If you have soil that is very degraded, you can rebuild that, but it takes quite a while. If you completely kill it with constant chemical abuse the natural process of recycling is broken, and you stop life.”</p>

   		<h5>The Death Deluge</h5>

   		<p>Hong Kong is crowded. So crowded that dying has become a tricky business.</p>
   		<p>That is, the crowded island city with a population of 7 million is in the midst of a massive burial crisis. You wouldn’t expect it, given that since the 1980s, most who die in Hong Kong are no longer even interred in the ground but housed in columbarias, buildings that house urns. But today even the columbarias require a five-year waiting list to receive “a one-square-foot wall niche.”</p>
   		<p>And it isn’t just Hong Kong. “Shortage of burial space is indeed an issue in many parts of the world, particularly in urban areas,” said Joe Sehee, founder of Green Burial Council, an environmental nonprofit based in California. The reason is simple: globally, 107 people die per minute and there's not enough room to bury them. The situation is compounded by aging populations and the fact that bodies already in the ground aren’t being moved.</p>
   		<p>London also suffers from overcrowding. Their problem is lack of graveyard real estate in the traditional sense: too many bodies, not enough earth. As a result, cemeteries are starting to think of burials creatively, said Basmajian. For example, people are sharing graves, or renting them for a period of time until the remains have fully decomposed. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has erected floating cemeteries, sending the dead to sea.</p>
   		<p>Nor are the states immune, said Basmajian. The historic Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn is “basically out of space.” In 2009, the New York Times reported that three bodies were stacked on top of each other at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. Even in Chicago, with its large dedicated cemetery space, the over-crowding problem is starting to rear its head.</p>
   		<p>“Some cemeteries here have run out of room,” said Benson.</p>
   		<p>However, Graceland Cemetery is restoring part of its grounds to make room for more family estate lots that cost $80,000 each, according to the cemetery website.</p>
   		<p>Space is a problem that will continue to grow, because planning room in a city for dedicated burial is not something often talked about, Basmajian added. His suggestion: begin using burial spaces as a multi-use facility. In the 19th century model of burials, cemeteries were parks and beautiful recreational facilities. Many of these cemeteries exist today, such as Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Boston, Massachusetts. This creates a solution where planners can have dedicated grave space within green space.</p>
   		<p>So are we running out of room to bury our dead?</p>
   		<p>“There will be room,” said Basmajian. “But people might not be buried where they want.”</p>

   		<h5>Grave Matters</h5>
   		
   		<p>“If we are to understand ourselves as mortal beings, then from the moment we are born we are dying.”</p>
   		<p>Death is a strange force. Our relation to it depends on many factors: culture, community, socio-economic status. Yet no matter how we approach the end of our existence, it is one of the core experiences that unite us, said social psychologist and University of California lecturer Wendy Martyna.</p>
   		<p>As Martyna puts it, “We all know that one day we will die.”</p>
   		<p>Yet psychologists say we conscientiously choose to forget the reality that we are mortal.</p>
   		<p>“Today, death has become taboo,” said Isabel Gutierrez, a research fellow of psychology at Northwestern University. Modern American society is “fearful of death and avoids the topic whenever possible,” she says.</p>
   		<p>According to Gutierrez’s research, this was not always the case. Back in the Middle Ages, death was an open and integral part of the fabric of life. A person’s passing became a public event, drawing family and friends. Even children took for granted the coming and passing of those within the community.</p>
   		<p>It was only later on that death and dying took on their current stigma. Unfortunately, this hush-hush attitude about one of life’s most important events can complicate the already difficult process of planning for funeral arrangements.</p>
   		<p>“Unless we can talk about it,” Martyna said, “we can’t begin to find what needs to be changed when we die.”</p>

   		<h5>The Green Escape</h5>

   		<p>Whether it is a decision to do a green burial or a traditional burial or cremation, one of the best things to do is to pre-plan your funeral. Funerals can be paid ahead of time and will ensure that family members do not get taken advantage of and spend more than they can afford during a stressful time in their lives.</p>
   		<p>You could “be paying mom’s funeral for the next five years – who wants to do that?” she said. And a green burial can cost considerably less than a traditional burial.</p>
   		<p>Jamal Ali, author of the book “Black and Green” estimates that a green burial starts at around $2,000 and a traditional burial can cost $10,000 or more.</p>
   		<p>There are also a long list of decisions to be made when planning a funeral. When you add in green burial options, there could be even more questions.</p>
   		<p>“There are a lot of decisions to be made when you are planning a funeral,” she said. “Fifty percent of those decisions you are going to have to do in three days.”</p>
   		<p>Preplanning a funeral can also let the planners of a funeral know of your wishes, so if you want a green burial it is already set and loved ones can focus on mourning the loss and celebrating the life of the deceased.</p>
   		<p>Jeff Jorgenson, founder of Elemental Cremation & Burial in Seattle, Washington, said that there is so much stuff to consider when planning a funeral that most people don’t know about it. Many don’t know that the ritual and ceremony can be the same, but the burial can be made to be less of a cost to the environment. Or that, in certain situations, embalming is not required and a direct burial can be done. Or that a concrete vault isn’t required by law, just by most cemeteries.</p>
   		<p>“The problem is when you watch someone die, there’s nothing comforting about a four foot grave and a linen shroud,” said Jorgenson.</p>
   		<p>“It takes a dialogue,” to let people know about their options in the after-life, he said, adding “green burials will increase” as time goes on and more people are aware.</p>
   		<p>But after considering all the options, many are making the same choice as Jamal Ali: “Bury me green or don’t bury me at all.”</p>
