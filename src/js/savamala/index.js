            <p>My name is Hailey and I am a developer in New York City with an eye on storytelling and digital strategy on the web. I love developing eye-catching websites that tell a story, whether about a brand, a campaign, or a literal story.</p>
            <p>I have a background in development, journalism, and integrated marketing, so I really do focus on all three rather than what is currently trending in development. And I have developed content and websites for many companies big and small, global and local.</p>
            <p>My passport is always getting a workout and I love working remotely around the world and the challenges it presents. I am also always talking about perfumes and you can commonly find me at a perfume shop on weekends.</p>
